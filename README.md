## üì¶ Example Output

If a commit message is invalid, you'll see something like:

```
- `abc1234`: **bad commit message**
  - Reason: Unknown commit type 'bad'
  - Suggestion: `fix: bad commit message`
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Reasons

- **Commit message is empty.**: No message was provided.
- **Missing commit type.**: The type (e.g., `fix`, `feat`) was not found.
- **Unknown commit type:**: The type used is not allowed (see config).
- **Unknown scope:**: The scope used is not allowed (see config).
- **Missing subject.**: No subject after the type/scope.
- **Subject starts with a space.**: The subject has a leading space.
- **Errors are now reported with improved clarity and detail (v1.0.4+)**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- **Merge commits are automatically skipped** (not checked for Conventional Commit compliance).
- Action works on both `push` and `pull_request` workflows.
- For best results, squash and merge PRs with proper commit messages.
